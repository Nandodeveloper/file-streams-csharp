# 📂 Data Flow Practice in C# 🚀  

This project demonstrates basic **data flow operations** in C# using various file handling techniques.  

## 🛠️ Features  

- `FileStream` for low-level control ⚙️  
- `StreamWriter` for simplified file writing ✍️  
- `StreamReader` for easy file reading 📖  
- `File` class for high-level operations 🏫  

## 🎯 Purpose  

This project serves as a practice exercise for:  
- Understanding different approaches to **file I/O** in C#  
- Comparing **stream-based** operations vs **utility methods**  
- Handling **file data flow** in various scenarios  

## 💻 Technologies Used  

- C#  
- .NET file I/O classes  
- `System.IO` namespace  

## 📚 Concepts Covered  

| Concept | Description |  
|---------|-------------|  
| File Operations | Creating, reading, and writing files |  
| Streams | Working with data streams |  
| Abstractions | Different levels of file operation abstractions |  
| Resource Management | Proper disposal of resources |
